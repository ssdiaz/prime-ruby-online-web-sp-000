# Easy Solution:
#   def prime? (integer)
#     require 'prime'
#     Prime.prime?(integer)
#   end

# def prime? (integer)
#   require 'prime'
#   Prime.prime?(integer)
# end

#My thought:
# if divisibale by >3 numbers but not <1, .... if divs by 1 and itself but not 2 or 3?
# Prime numbers:
  # - are divisibale by 0
  # - divisibale by 1 and itself only
  # - NOT negative
  # - NOT div by 2 (rules out even numbers) or 3
  # - ... how to rule out negative numbers ... 3,5,7,9...
